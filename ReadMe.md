# ReadMe

The data that was used for this project was from the 1994 Census. It originated from UCI's machine learning repository and provided by Udacity.

## Actions Performed

This code is split into a training and testing set and then is tested by three different models. The models used are Random Forest, Gradient Boost and Ada Boos.

## Results

The naive predictor had an accuracy score of about 25% and an F-score of about 30% (which is higher than accuracy because the ùõΩ=0.5). The best performing model was Gradient Boosting, whose unoptimized model had an accuracy score of 87% and F-score of 75%. After tuning the model, the accuracy and F-score increased by about 1%.
